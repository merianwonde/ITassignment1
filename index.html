      <p style="line-height:20px">
        During my time as a student I have been able to develop the way I learn and interact with each other to a degree that has also helped me to mature into a better person.I have come to believe that this maturity will help me to develop into a better thinker as well,one has the patient to listen and take consideration of what others have to say.Iconsider that the act of learning a two way avenue that has to be taken seriously.It is one that involves the teacher and my family.The way each of them have helped me to think about how my actions,and the way I choose to study my lessons and develop as a student, has made a tremendous imopact on my life.This impact is one that I will carry into the feature as I myself,especially with close follow up and assistance of my family, advance in my professional studying. I have learnt to build my ideas and thoughts around a system of interaction.
